- 👋 Hi, I’m @OwOwMySpleen, a UK-based aspiring lawyer trying to have some fun and potentially gain professional coding skills.
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity and data privacy!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Python to start projects independently + to gain a better sense of how cybersecurity vulnerabilities work.
     Am also generally interested on using Python and CSS/C++ to make digital art, silly little games and anything else creative!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on begginer and intermediate projects to get a hang on the language + any legaltech or otherwise law-related things.
- 📫 You can reach me here or through email at SpleenDestroyer900@pm.me
